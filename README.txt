Inside the "src" directory you will find the sourcecode for both programs, and the source of Radiance.

In order to compile the programs, you have to go to the Terminal in this directory, and run

     make mkSchedule
     make uSchedule

In order to clean the programs you can

     make redo

Or, you can rebuild the programs by running

     make redo all
     
That should do.

I guess you have to install XCODE (free from the appstore).
