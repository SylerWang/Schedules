       _P_c_o_n_d  conditions  a  Radiance  picture for output to a display or hard
       copy device.  If the dynamic range of the scene  exceeds  that  of  the
       display (as is usually the case), _p_c_o_n_d will compress the dynamic range
       of the picture such that both dark and bright regions are visible.   In
       addition,  certain limitations in human vision may be mimicked in order
       to provide an appearance similar to the experience one  might  have  in
       the actual scene.

       Command line switches turn flags off and on, changing program behavior.
       A switch given by itself toggles the flag from off to on or on  to  off
       depending  on its previous state.  A switch followed by a '+' turns the
       option on explicitly.  A switch followed by a '-' turns the option off.
       The  default  is all switches off.  Other options specify output device
       parameters in order to get more accurate color and contrast.

       --hh_[_+_-_]    Mimic human visual response in the output.  The goal of  this
                 process  is to produce output that correlates strongly with a
                 person's subjective impression of a scene.  This switch is  a
                 bundle of the _-_a_, _-_v_, _-_s and _-_c options.

       --aa_[_+_-_]    Defocus  darker regions of the image to simulate human visual
                 acuity loss.  This option will not affect well-lit scenes.

       --vv_[_+_-_]    Add veiling glare due to very bright regions  in  the  image.
                 This  simulates  internal  scattering in the human eye, which
                 results in a loss of visible contrast near bright sources.

       --ss_[_+_-_]    Use the human contrast sensitivity  function  in  determining
                 the  exposure  for the image.  A darker scene will have rela-
                 tively lower exposure with lower  contrast  than  a  well-lit
                 scene.

       --cc_[_+_-_]    If  parts  of  the image are in the mesopic or scotopic range
                 where the cone photoreceptors  lose  their  efficiency,  this
                 switch will cause a corresponding loss of color visibility in
                 the output and a shift to a scotopic (blue-dominant) response
                 function.

       --ww_[_+_-_]    Use  a  center-weighted  average for the exposure rather than
                 the default uniform average.  This may improve  the  exposure
                 for scenes with high or low peripheral brightness.

       --ii _f_i_x_f_r_a_c
                 Set  the  relative  importance of fixation points to _f_i_x_f_r_a_c_,
                 which is a value between 0 and 1.  If _f_i_x_f_r_a_c  is  zero  (the
                 default), then no fixation points are used in determining the
                 local or global adaptation.  If _f_i_x_f_r_a_c is greater than zero,
                 then  a  list  of  fixation  points is read from the standard
                 input.  These points are given as tab-separated (x,y) picture
                 coordinates, such as those produced by the _-_o_p option of _x_i_m_-
                 _a_g_e_(_1_)_.  The foveal samples about these fixation points  will
                 then  be  weighted  together with the global averaging scheme
                 such that the fixations receive _f_i_x_f_r_a_c of the total  weight.
                 If  _f_i_x_f_r_a_c is one, then only the fixation points are consid-
                 ered for adaptation.

       --II_[_+_-_]    Rather than computing a histogram of foveal samples from  the
                 source picture, use the precomputed histogram provided on the
                 standard input.  This data should be given in  pairs  of  the
                 base-10 logarithm of world luminance and a count for each bin
                 in ascending order, as  computed  by  the  _p_h_i_s_t_o_(_1_)  script.
                 This  option  is  useful for producing identical exposures of
                 multiple pictures (as in an animation), and provides  greater
                 control over the histogram computation.

       --ll_[_+_-_]    Use  a  linear  response  function  rather  than the standard
                 dynamic range compression algorithm.  This will  prevent  the
                 loss  of  usable  physical  values  in  the  output  picture,
                 although some parts of the resulting image may be too dark or
                 too bright to see.

       --ee _e_x_p_v_a_l Set  the exposure adjustment for the picture to _e_x_p_v_a_l_.  This
                 may either be a real multiplier, or a (fractional) number  of
                 f-stops  preceeded  by  a  '+' or '-'.  This option implies a
                 linear response (see the _-_l option above).

       --uu _L_d_m_a_x  Specifies the top of the luminance range for the target  out-
                 put  device.  That is, the luminance (in candelas/m^2) for an
                 output pixel value of (R,G,B)=(1,1,1).  The default value  is
                 100 cd/m^2.

       --dd _L_d_d_y_n  Specifies  the  dynamic  range  for the target output device,
                 which is the ratio of the maximum and minimum usable  display
                 luminances.  The default value is 32.

       --pp _x_r _y_r _x_g _y_g _x_b _y_b _x_w _y_w
                 Specifies  the  RGB  primaries  for the target output device.
                 These are the 1931 CIE (x,y)  chromaticity  values  for  red,
                 green, blue and white, respectively.

       --ff _m_a_c_b_e_t_h_._c_a_l
                 Use  the  given  output file from _m_a_c_b_e_t_h_c_a_l_(_1_) to precorrect
                 the color and contrast for the target  output  device.   This
                 does  a  more  thorough  job than a simple primary correction
                 using the _-_p option.  Only one of _-_f or _-_p may be given.

       --xx _m_a_p_f_i_l_e
                 Put out the final mapping from  world  luminance  to  display
                 luminance to _m_a_p_f_i_l_e_.  This file will contain values from the
                 minimum usable world luminance  to  the  maximum  (in  cande-
                 las/m^2) in one column, and their corresponding display lumi-
                 nance values (also in candelas/m^2)  in  the  second  column.
                 This  file may be used for debugging purposes, or to plot the
                 mapping function created by _p_c_o_n_d_.

       To display an image as a person might perceive it in the actual scene:

         pcond -h final.hdr > display.hdr
         ximage display.hdr ; rm display.hdr &

       To do the same on a 24-bit display with known primary values:

         setenv DISPLAY_PRIMARIES ".580 .340 .281 .570 .153 .079 .333 .333"
         pcond -h -p $DISPLAY_PRIMARIES final.hdr | ximage &

       To prepare a picture to be sent to a film recorder destined  eventually
       for  a  slide  projector with a minimum and maximum screen luminance of
       1.5 and 125 candelas/m^2, respectively:

         pcond -d 83 -u 125 final.hdr > film.hdr

       To  do  the  same  if  the  output  colors  of   the   standard   image
       "ray/lib/lib/macbeth_spec.hdr" have been measured:

         macbethcal -c mbfilm.xyY > film.cal
         pcond -d 83 -u 125 -f film.cal final.hdr > film.hdr

       To  further  tweak the exposure to bring out certain areas indicated by
       dragging the right mouse button over them in _x_i_m_a_g_e_:

         ximage -op -t 75 final.hdr | pcond -i .5 -d 83  -u  125  -f  film.cal
         final.hdr > film.hdr

       To use a histogram computed on every 10th animation frame:

         phisto frame*0.hdr > global.hist
         pcond -I -s -c frame0352.hdr < global.hist | ra_tiff - frame0352.tif
