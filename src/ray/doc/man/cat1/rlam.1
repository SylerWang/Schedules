       _R_l_a_m  simply  joins records (or lines) from multiple inputs, separating
       them with the given string (TAB by default).  Different separators  may
       be  given  for  different  files by specifying additional _-_t options in
       between each file name.  Note that  there  is  no  space  between  this
       option and its argument.  If none of the input files uses an ASCII sep-
       arator, then no end-of-line character will be printed, either.

       An input is either a stream  or  a  command.   Commands  are  given  in
       quotes,  and  begin with an exclamantion point ('!').  If the inputs do
       not have the same number of lines, then shorter files  will  stop  con-
       tributing to the output as they run out.

       The _-_i_a option may be used to specify ASCII input (the default), or the
       _-_i_f option may be used to indicated binary IEEE 32-bit floats on input.
       Similarly,  the  _-_i_d  and  _-_i_w  options  may be used to indicate binary
       64-bit doubles or integer words, respectively.  If an number is immedi-
       ately  follows  any  of  these options, then it indicates that multiple
       such values are expected for each record.  For example, _-_i_f_3  indicates
       three floats per input record for the next named input.  In the case of
       the _-_i_a option, no number indicates one line per input record, and num-
       bers  greater  than  zero  indicate  that  many  characters exactly per
       record.  For binary input formts,  no  number  implies  one  value  per
       record.   For  anything other than EOL-separated input, the default tab
       separator is reset to the empty string.

       A hyphen ('-') by itself can be used to indicate  the  standard  input,
       and may appear multiple times.

       To join files output1 and output2, separated by a comma:

         rlam -t, output1 output2

       To join a file with line numbers (starting at 0) and its reverse:

         cnt `wc -l < lam.c` | rlam - -t: lam.c -t '!tail -r lam.c'

       To join four data files, each having three doubles per record:

         rlam -id3 file1.dbl file2.dbl file3.dbl file4.dbl > combined.dbl
