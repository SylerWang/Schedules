       _R_a_d_d_e_p_e_n_d  uses _g_e_t_b_b_o_x_(_1_) to expand scene file arguments and find file
       dependencies for _m_a_k_e_(_1_) or _r_a_d_(_1_)_.  _R_a_d_d_e_p_e_n_d looks only in  the  cur-
       rent directory, so dependencies hidden elsewhere in the filesystem will
       not be found or named.

       The output is the name of files, one per line, that were accessed  dur-
       ing  the expansion of the input file arguments.  The file arguments are
       excluded from the list.  If no input  files  are  given,  the  standard
       input is read.

       On  some  older  NFS  systems,  the  file  access dates are not updated
       promptly.  As a result, _r_a_d_d_e_p_e_n_d may not be  100%  reliable  on  these
       systems.  If the output seems to be missing essential files, this is no
       doubt why.  The only fix is to put in a longer sleep time  between  the
       _g_e_t_b_b_o_x call and the final _l_s_(_1_)_.
