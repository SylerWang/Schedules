       _G_l_a_r_e  is  an  interactive script for executing programs used to locate
       glare sources and compute glare indices and visual comfort probability.
       If  no  _g_l_a_r_e_f_i_l_e is given, the program prompts the user for a one.  If
       the file does not exist, _g_l_a_r_e asks the user some questions  about  the
       scene  in question then runs _f_i_n_d_g_l_a_r_e_(_1_) to compute values to store in
       the file.  _G_l_a_r_e then presents the user a menu of available glare index
       calculations.   After choosing a calculation, _g_l_a_r_e offers to store the
       result (usually not useful) or plot the information (but only for  mul-
       tiple glare angles).

       If  you  are  creating  a new _g_l_a_r_e_f_i_l_e_, it usually works best to start
       with a displayed image for reference during the interrogation.
