       _R_t_r_a_c_e  traces  rays from the standard input through the RADIANCE scene
       given by _o_c_t_r_e_e and sends the results to  the  standard  output.   (The
       octree  may  be given as the output of a command enclosed in quotes and
       preceded by a `!'.)  Input for each ray is:

            xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir

       If the direction vector is (0,0,0), a bogus record is printed  and  the
       output  is flushed if the _-_x value is unset or zero.  (See the notes on
       this option below.)  This may be useful for programs that run _r_t_r_a_c_e as
       a  separate  process.   In  the second form, the default values for the
       options (modified by those options present) are printed  with  a  brief
       explanation.

       Options  may be given on the command line and/or read from the environ-
       ment and/or read from a file.  A command argument beginning with a dol-
       lar  sign  ('$')  is  immediately replaced by the contents of the given
       environment variable.  A command argument beginning  with  an  at  sign
       ('@')  is immediately replaced by the contents of the given file.  Most
       options are followed by one or more arguments, which must be  separated
       from  the option and each other by white space.  The exceptions to this
       rule are the boolean options.  Normally, the appearance  of  a  boolean
       option  causes  a feature to be "toggled", that is switched from off to
       on or on to off depending on its previous state.  Boolean  options  may
       also be set explicitly by following them immediately with a '+' or '-',
       meaning on or off, respectively.  Synonyms for '+' are any of the char-
       acters "yYtT1", and synonyms for '-' are any of the characters "nNfF0".
       All other characters will generate an error.

       --ff_i_o      Format input according to the character _i and output  accord-
                 ing  to  the  character  _o_.  _R_t_r_a_c_e understands the following
                 input and output formats:  'a' for ascii, 'f' for single-pre-
                 cision  floating point, and 'd' for double-precision floating
                 point.  In addition to these three choices, the character 'c'
                 may  be used to denote 4-byte floating point (Radiance) color
                 format for the output of values only _(_-_o_v option, below).  If
                 the output character is missing, the input format is used.

                 Note that there is no space between this option and its argu-
                 ment.

       --oo_s_p_e_c    Produce output fields  according  to  _s_p_e_c_.   Characters  are
                 interpreted as follows:

                 o    origin (input)

                 d    direction (normalized)

                 v    value (radiance)

                 V    contribution (radiance)

                 w    weight

                 W    color coefficient

                 l    effective length of ray

                 L    first intersection distance

                 c    local (u,v) coordinates

                 p    point of intersection

                 n    normal at intersection (perturbed)

                 N    normal at intersection (unperturbed)

                 s    surface name

                 m    modifier name

                 M    material name

                 ~    tilde (end of trace marker)

                 If  the letter 't' appears in _s_p_e_c_, then the fields following
                 will be printed for every ray  traced,  not  just  the  final
                 result.   If  the capital letter 'T' is given instead of 't',
                 then all rays will be reported, including shadow testing rays
                 to light sources.  Spawned rays are indented one tab for each
                 level.  The tilde marker ('~') is a handy way of  differenti-
                 ating  the  final  ray value from daughter values in a traced
                 ray tree, and usually appears right before  the  't'  or  'T'
                 output  flags.  E.g., _-_o_v_~_T_m_W will emit a tilde followed by a
                 tab at the end of each trace, which  can  be  easily  distin-
                 guished even in binary output.

                 Note that there is no space between this option and its argu-
                 ment.

       --ttee _m_o_d   Append _m_o_d to the trace exclude list, so that it will not  be
                 reported  by  the  trace option _(_-_o_*_t_*_)_.  Any ray striking an
                 object having _m_o_d as its modifier will not be reported to the
                 standard output with the rest of the rays being traced.  This
                 option has no effect unless either the 't' or 'T' option  has
                 been  given  as  part of the output specifier.  Any number of
                 excluded modifiers may be given, but each must  appear  in  a
                 separate option.

       --ttii _m_o_d   Add  _m_o_d  to  the  trace  include  list,  so  that it will be
                 reported by the trace option.  The program can use either  an
                 include list or an exclude list, but not both.

       --ttEE _f_i_l_e  Same  as _-_t_e_, except read modifiers to be excluded from _f_i_l_e_.
                 The RAYPATH environment variable determines which directories
                 are searched for this file.  The modifier names are separated
                 by white space in the file.

       --ttII _f_i_l_e  Same as _-_t_i_, except read modifiers to be included from  _f_i_l_e_.

       --ii        Boolean  switch  to  compute  irradiance rather than radiance
                 values.  This only affects the final result,  substituting  a
                 Lambertian surface and multiplying the radiance by pi.  Glass
                 and other transparent surfaces are ignored during this stage.
                 Light  sources still appear with their original radiance val-
                 ues, though the _-_d_v option (below) may be  used  to  override
                 this.   This  option is especially useful in conjunction with
                 ximage(1) for computing illuminance at scene points.

       --uu        Boolean switch to control uncorrelated random sampling.  When
                 "off",  a  low-discrepancy  sequence  is  used, which reduces
                 variance but can result in a brushed appearance  in  specular
                 highlights.   When "on", pure Monte Carlo sampling is used in
                 all calculations.

       --II        Boolean switch to compute irradiance  rather  than  radiance,
                 with  the  input  origin and direction interpreted instead as
                 measurement point and orientation.

       --hh        Boolean switch for information header on output.

       --xx _r_e_s    Set the x resolution to _r_e_s_.   The  output  will  be  flushed
                 after  every  _r_e_s  input rays.  A value of zero means that no
                 output flushing will take place.

       --yy _r_e_s    Set the y resolution to _r_e_s_.  The program will exit after _r_e_s
                 scanlines have been processed, where a scanline is the number
                 of rays given by the _-_x option, or 1 if _-_x is zero.  A  value
                 of zero means the program will not halt until the end of file
                 is reached.

                 If both _-_x and _-_y options are given, a resolution  string  is
                 printed  at the beginning of the output.  This is mostly use-
                 ful for recovering image dimensions with _p_v_a_l_u_e_(_1_)_,  and  for
                 creating  valid Radiance picture files using the color output
                 format.  (See the _-_f option, above.)

       --nn _n_p_r_o_c  Execute in parallel on _n_p_r_o_c local processes.  This option is
                 incompatible  with  the  _-_P  and _-_P_P_, options.  Multiple pro-
                 cesses also do not work properly with ray tree  output  using
                 any  of the _-_o_*_t_* options.  There is no benefit from specify-
                 ing more processes than there are cores available on the sys-
                 tem or the _-_x setting, which forces a wait at each flush.

       --ddjj _f_r_a_c  Set  the  direct  jittering to _f_r_a_c_.  A value of zero samples
                 each source at specific sample points  (see  the  _-_d_s  option
                 below),  giving a smoother but somewhat less accurate render-
                 ing.  A positive value causes rays  to  be  distributed  over
                 each  source  sample according to its size, resulting in more
                 accurate penumbras.  This option should never be greater than
                 1,  and  may  even  cause problems (such as speckle) when the
                 value is smaller.  A warning about aiming failure will issued
                 if _f_r_a_c is too large.

       --ddss _f_r_a_c  Set  the  direct sampling ratio to _f_r_a_c_.  A light source will
                 be subdivided until the width of each sample area divided  by
                 the  distance  to  the illuminated point is below this ratio.
                 This assures accuracy in regions close to large area  sources
                 at  a  slight  computational  expense.  A value of zero turns
                 source subdivision off, sending at most  one  shadow  ray  to
                 each light source.

       --ddtt _f_r_a_c  Set  the  direct threshold to _f_r_a_c_.  Shadow testing will stop
                 when the potential contribution of at least the next  and  at
                 most  all  remaining light sources is less than this fraction
                 of the accumulated value.  (See the _-_d_c option  below.)   The
                 remaining light source contributions are approximated statis-
                 tically.  A value of zero means that all light  sources  will
                 be tested for shadow.

       --ddcc _f_r_a_c  Set  the direct certainty to _f_r_a_c_.  A value of one guarantees
                 that the absolute accuracy of the direct calculation will  be
                 equal  to or better than that given in the _-_d_t specification.
                 A value of zero only insures that all shadow lines  resulting
                 in  a contrast change greater than the _-_d_t specification will
                 be calculated.

       --ddrr _N     Set the number of relays for secondary sources to _N_.  A value
                 of  0  means that secondary sources will be ignored.  A value
                 of 1 means that sources will be made  into  first  generation
                 secondary  sources;  a value of 2 means that first generation
                 secondary sources will also be made  into  second  generation
                 secondary sources, and so on.

       --ddpp _D     Set  the  secondary source presampling density to D.  This is
                 the number of samples per steradian  that  will  be  used  to
                 determine  ahead of time whether or not it is worth following
                 shadow rays through all the reflections and/or  transmissions
                 associated  with a secondary source path.  A value of 0 means
                 that the full secondary source path will always be tested for
                 shadows if it is tested at all.

       --ddvv       Boolean switch for light source visibility.  With this switch
                 off, sources will be black when viewed directly although they
                 will  still  participate  in  the  direct  calculation.  This
                 option is mostly for the program _m_k_i_l_l_u_m_(_1_) to avoid inappro-
                 priate  counting  of light sources, but it may also be desir-
                 able in conjunction with the _-_i option.

       --ssjj _f_r_a_c  Set the specular sampling jitter to _f_r_a_c_.  This is the degree
                 to  which the highlights are sampled for rough specular mate-
                 rials.  A value of one means  that  all  highlights  will  be
                 fully sampled using distributed ray tracing.  A value of zero
                 means that no jittering will take place, and all  reflections
                 will appear sharp even when they should be diffuse.

       --sstt _f_r_a_c  Set  the  specular  sampling  threshold to _f_r_a_c_.  This is the
                 minimum fraction of reflection or transmission,  under  which
                 no  specular  sampling  is  performed.  A value of zero means
                 that highlights will always be sampled by  tracing  reflected
                 or transmitted rays.  A value of one means that specular sam-
                 pling is never used.   Highlights  from  light  sources  will
                 always  be  correct, but reflections from other surfaces will
                 be approximated using an ambient value.  A sampling threshold
                 between  zero and one offers a compromise between image accu-
                 racy and rendering time.

       --bbvv       Boolean switch for back face visibility.   With  this  switch
                 off,  back  faces  of opaque objects will be invisible to all
                 rays.  This is dangerous unless  the  model  was  constructed
                 such that all surface normals on opaque objects face outward.
                 Although turning off back face visibility does not save  much
                 computation  time  under most circumstances, it may be useful
                 as a tool for scene debugging, or  for  seeing  through  one-
                 sided  walls  from the outside.  This option has no effect on
                 transparent or translucent materials.

       --aavv _r_e_d _g_r_n _b_l_u
                 Set the ambient value to a radiance of _r_e_d _g_r_n _b_l_u _.  This is
                 the  final  value used in place of an indirect light calcula-
                 tion.  If the number of ambient bounces is one or greater and
                 the ambient value weight is non-zero (see _-_a_w and _-_a_b below),
                 this value may be modified by the computed indirect values to
                 improve overall accuracy.

       --aaww _N     Set  the  relative weight of the ambient value given with the
                 _-_a_v option to _N_.  As new indirect irradiances  are  computed,
                 they  will modify the default ambient value in a moving aver-
                 age, with the specified weight assigned to the initial  value
                 given  on  the  command and all other weights set to 1.  If a
                 value of 0 is given with this option, then the initial  ambi-
                 ent  value  is  never modified.  This is the safest value for
                 scenes with large differences in indirect contributions, such
                 as when both indoor and outdoor (daylight) areas are visible.

       --aabb _N     Set the number of ambient bounces to _N_.  This is the  maximum
                 number  of  diffuse bounces computed by the indirect calcula-
                 tion.  A value of zero implies no indirect calculation.

       --aarr _r_e_s   Set the ambient resolution to _r_e_s_.  This number  will  deter-
                 mine the maximum density of ambient values used in interpola-
                 tion.  Error will start to increase on surfaces spaced closer
                 than  the  scene size divided by the ambient resolution.  The
                 maximum ambient value density is the  scene  size  times  the
                 ambient  accuracy  (see  the _-_a_a option below) divided by the
                 ambient resolution.  The scene size can be  determined  using
                 _g_e_t_i_n_f_o_(_1_) with the _-_d option on the input octree.

       --aaaa _a_c_c   Set  the  ambient  accuracy to _a_c_c_.  This value will approxi-
                 mately equal the error from indirect  illuminance  interpola-
                 tion.  A value of zero implies no interpolation.

       --aadd _N     Set  the  number of ambient divisions to _N_.  The error in the
                 Monte Carlo  calculation  of  indirect  illuminance  will  be
                 inversely  proportional to the square root of this number.  A
                 value of zero implies no indirect calculation.

       --aass _N     Set the number of ambient super-samples to _N_.   Super-samples
                 are  applied  only to the ambient divisions which show a sig-
                 nificant change.

       --aaff _f_n_a_m_e Set the ambient file to _f_n_a_m_e_.  This is where indirect  illu-
                 minance  will  be  stored  and retrieved.  Normally, indirect
                 illuminance values are kept in memory and lost when the  pro-
                 gram  finishes  or  dies.  By using a file, different invoca-
                 tions can share illuminance values, saving time in the compu-
                 tation.   The ambient file is in a machine-independent binary
                 format which can be examined with _l_o_o_k_a_m_b_(_1_)_.

                 The ambient file may also be used as a means of communication
                 and  data sharing between simultaneously executing processes.
                 The same file may be used  by  multiple  processes,  possibly
                 running  on different machines and accessing the file via the
                 network (ie.  _n_f_s_(_4_)_)_.  The network lock manager _l_o_c_k_d_(_8_)  is
                 used to insure that this information is used consistently.

                 If  any  calculation  parameters  are changed or the scene is
                 modified, the old ambient file should be removed so that  the
                 calculation  can  start  over from scratch.  For convenience,
                 the original ambient parameters are listed in the  header  of
                 the  ambient  file.  _G_e_t_i_n_f_o_(_1_) may be used to print out this
                 information.

       --aaee _m_o_d   Append _m_o_d to the ambient exclude list, so that it  will  not
                 be  considered  during  the  indirect calculation.  This is a
                 hack for speeding the indirect computation by  ignoring  cer-
                 tain objects.  Any object having _m_o_d as its modifier will get
                 the default ambient level rather  than  a  calculated  value.
                 Any  number of excluded modifiers may be given, but each must
                 appear in a separate option.

       --aaii _m_o_d   Add _m_o_d to the ambient include list, so that it will be  con-
                 sidered during the indirect calculation.  The program can use
                 either an include list or an exclude list, but not both.

       --aaEE _f_i_l_e  Same as _-_a_e_, except read modifiers to be excluded from  _f_i_l_e_.
                 The RAYPATH environment variable determines which directories
                 are searched for this file.  The modifier names are separated
                 by white space in the file.

       --aaII _f_i_l_e  Same  as _-_a_i_, except read modifiers to be included from _f_i_l_e_.

       --mmee _r_e_x_t _g_e_x_t _b_e_x_t
                 Set the global medium extinction coefficient to the indicated
                 color,  in  units  of  1/distance  (distance in world coordi-
                 nates).  Light will be scattered or  absorbed  over  distance
                 according  to  this  value.  The ratio of scattering to total
                 scattering plus absorption is set by  the  albedo  parameter,
                 described below.

       --mmaa _r_a_l_b _g_a_l_b _b_a_l_b
                 Set the global medium albedo to the given value between 0 0 0
                 and 1 1 1.  A zero value means that all light not transmitted
                 by  the  medium  is absorbed.  A unitary value means that all
                 light not transmitted by the medium is scattered in some  new
                 direction.   The  isotropy of scattering is determined by the
                 Heyney-Greenstein parameter, described below.

       --mmgg _g_e_c_c  Set the medium Heyney-Greenstein  eccentricity  parameter  to
                 _g_e_c_c_.   This  parameter  determines  how  strongly scattering
                 favors the forward direction.  A value of  0  indicates  per-
                 fectly isotropic scattering.  As this parameter approaches 1,
                 scattering tends to prefer the forward direction.

       --mmss _s_a_m_p_d_i_s_t
                 Set the medium sampling distance to _s_a_m_p_d_i_s_t_, in world  coor-
                 dinate  units.   During  source  scattering, this will be the
                 average distance between adjacent  samples.   A  value  of  0
                 means  that  only  one  sample will be taken per light source
                 within a given scattering volume.

       --llrr _N     Limit reflections to a maximum of _N_, if N is a positive inte-
                 ger.  If _N is zero or negative, then Russian roulette is used
                 for ray termination, and the _-_l_w setting (below) must be pos-
                 itive.   If N is a negative integer, then this sets the upper
                 limit of reflections past  which  Russian  roulette  will  be
                 used.   In scenes with dielectrics and total internal reflec-
                 tion, a setting of 0 (no limit) may cause a stack overflow.

       --llww _f_r_a_c  Limit the weight of each ray to a minimum  of  _f_r_a_c_.   During
                 ray-tracing,  a  record is kept of the estimated contribution
                 (weight) a ray would have in the image.  If  this  weight  is
                 less  than  the specified minimum and the _-_l_r setting (above)
                 is positive, the  ray  is  not  traced.   Otherwise,  Russian
                 roulette is used to continue rays with a probability equal to
                 the ray weight divided by the given _f_r_a_c_.

       --lldd       Boolean switch to limit ray distance.  If this option is set,
                 then rays will only be traced as far as the magnitude of each
                 direction vector.  Otherwise, vector magnitude is ignored and
                 rays are traced to infinity.

       --ee _e_f_i_l_e  Send  error messages and progress reports to _e_f_i_l_e instead of
                 the standard error.

       --ww        Boolean switch to suppress warning messages.

       --PP _p_f_i_l_e  Execute in a persistent mode,  using  _p_f_i_l_e  as  the  control
                 file.  Persistent execution means that after reaching end-of-
                 file on its input, _r_t_r_a_c_e will fork a child process that will
                 wait  for  another  _r_t_r_a_c_e command with the same _-_P option to
                 attach to it.  (Note that since the rest of the command  line
                 options  will  be those of the original invocation, it is not
                 necessary to give any arguments  besides  _-_P  for  subsequent
                 calls.)   Killing  the  process  is achieved with the _k_i_l_l_(_1_)
                 command.  (The process ID in the first line of _p_f_i_l_e  may  be
                 used  to  identify  the waiting _r_t_r_a_c_e process.)  This option
                 may be used with the _-_f_r option of _p_i_n_t_e_r_p_(_1_)  to  avoid  the
                 cost of starting up _r_t_r_a_c_e many times.

       --PPPP _p_f_i_l_e Execute in continuous-forking persistent mode, using _p_f_i_l_e as
                 the control file.  The difference between this option and the
                 _-_P  option described above is the creation of multiple dupli-
                 cate processes to handle any number of attaches.   This  pro-
                 vides  a  simple  and reliable mechanism of memory sharing on
                 most multiprocessing platforms, since the _f_o_r_k_(_2_) system call
                 will share memory on a copy-on-write basis.
