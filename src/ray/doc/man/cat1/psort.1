       _P_s_o_r_t reads each metafile _f_i_l_e in sequence and sorts primitives between
       globals according to the option specification.  Lower case options mean
       the  corresponding  minimum, upper case indicates the maximum value.  A
       '+' before the option means sort in order  of  increasing  values,  '-'
       means  decreasing.  The order the options appear on the command line is
       the order in which the extrema are examined.  For example, the  options
       _-_Y  _+_x  would  mean "sort on decreasing ymax, then increasing xmin val-
       ues".

       If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.

       To sort the file "meta" in order of increasing  xmax,  then  decreasing
       ymin:

         psort +X -y meta

       Aborting the program will sometimes leave files in /tmp.
