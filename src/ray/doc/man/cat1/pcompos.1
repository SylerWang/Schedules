       _P_c_o_m_p_o_s  arranges and composites RADIANCE pictures and sends the result
       to the standard output.  Each input picture must be accompanied  by  an
       anchor  point  (unless  the _-_a option is used, see below).  This anchor
       point is the usually position of the picture's left lower corner in the
       final  output,  but  can be changed for individual pictures with an _=_S_S
       option, where _S is one of '-', '+' or '0', indicating the minimum, max-
       imum  or  center  of  the image, respectively.  (For example, _=_+_- would
       indicate the anchor is relative to the  right  lower  corner,  and  _=_-_0
       would indicate the anchor is relative to the center of the left edge.)
       Negative anchor coordinates result in the input being  cropped  at  the
       origin.   By default, the size of the output picture will be just large
       enough to encompass all the  input  files.   By  specifying  a  smaller
       dimension  using  the  _-_x and _-_y options, input files can be cropped at
       the upper boundary.  Specifying a larger dimension produces  a  border.
       The  _-_b  option  specifies  a background color to appear wherever input
       files do not cover.  The default value is black (0 0 0).  The _-_h option
       may  be used to reduce the information header size, which can grow dis-
       proportionately after multiple runs of _p_c_o_m_p_o_s and/or _p_c_o_m_b_(_1_)_.

       If input files overlap, later pictures will overwrite earlier ones.  By
       default,  input  files  are  copied  unconditionally  within the output
       boundaries.  The _-_t option specifies a lower threshold intensity  under
       which  input  pixels  will  not be copied to the output.  The _+_t option
       specifies an upper threshold.  These options  are  useful  for  cutting
       around irregular boundaries in the input.

       The  _-_l  option  can be used to specify a label for a specific picture,
       which will be given a height determined by the _-_l_h option  (default  24
       pixels) and placed in the upper left corner of the picture.  This label
       is generated by the program _p_s_i_g_n_(_1_)_.  The _-_l_a option instructs _p_c_o_m_p_o_s
       to  label each picture automatically by its name.  This is particularly
       useful in conjunction with the _-_a option for  producing  a  catalog  of
       images  (see  example below).  The _-_l option may still be used to over-
       ride the default label for a picture.

       The _-_a option can be used to automatically compute anchor  points  that
       place  successive  pictures  next  to each other in _n_c_o_l_s columns.  The
       ordering will place the first picture in the  lower  left  corner,  the
       next  just to the right of it, and so on for _n_c_o_l_s pictures.  Then, the
       next row up repeats the pattern until all the input pictures have  been
       added  to  the  output.  If the pictures are of different size, _p_c_o_m_p_o_s
       will end up leaving some background areas in the output picture.  There
       will  also be an unfinished row at the top if the number of pictures is
       not evenly divided by _n_c_o_l_s_.  The _-_s _N option will cause each image  to
       be  separated  by  at  least N pixels.  The _-_o _x_0 _y_0 option specifies a
       nonzero anchor point for the bottom left image.

       The standard input can be specified with a  hyphen  ('-').   A  command
       that  produces  a  RADIANCE  picture can be given in place of a file by
       preceeding it with an exclamation point ('!').

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       To put a copyright label at the bottom of a picture:

         psign Copyright 1987 | pcompos inp.hdr 0 0 +t .5 - 384 64 > out.hdr

       To make a catalog of images separated by white 10-pixel borders:

         pcompos -la -a 4 -s 10 -b 1 1 1 dog*.hdr > alldogs.hdr

NNOOTTEESS
       Since there is a limit to the number of open files and processes, large
       collections  of  images  must be created in stages.  Even if the system
       limit on open files is large, _p_c_o_m_p_o_s places an artificial limit of  64
       on the number of open files and/or processes.
