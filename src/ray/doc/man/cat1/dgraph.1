       _D_g_r_a_p_h reads each graph _f_i_l_e in sequence and converts it to a character
       plot displayable on any ascii device.  If no files are given, the stan-
       dard input is read.

       Across  the top of the plot, the extrema are printed.  This is the only
       indication of the axis size.  Curves are represented with their respec-
       tive  letter  ('A' for curve A, etc.) at each point.  Where two or more
       curves cross, a number is shown instead.

       The size of the output array can be specified as a  certain  _w_i_d_t_h  and
       _l_e_n_g_t_h_.  The default size is 79 by 22.

       Variables  can  be  set  explicitly  with _+_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _v_a_l_u_e options.  See
       bgraph(1) for details.
