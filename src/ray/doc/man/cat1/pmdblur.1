       _P_m_d_b_l_u_r  takes  two  viewfiles  and generates _n_s_a_m_p views starting from
       _v_0_f_i_l_e and moving towards _v_1_f_i_l_e_, simulating an  aperture  of  diameter
       _a_p_e_r_t_u_r_e  in  world  coordinate  units.   When  rendered  and  averaged
       together, these views will result in a picture with motion  and  depth-
       of-field blur due to a camera changing from v0 to v1 in a relative time
       unit of 1, whose shutter is open starting at v0 for _s_p_e_e_d of these time
       units.   Either  _p_i_n_t_e_r_p_(_1_)  or _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) may be called to do the actual
       work.  (The given _v_0_f_i_l_e must also be passed on the command line to the
       chosen  renderer,  since  _p_m_d_b_l_u_r provides supplemental view specifica-
       tions only.)

       For _p_i_n_t_e_r_p_, feed the output of _p_m_d_b_l_u_r to the standard input  of  _p_i_n_-
       _t_e_r_p  and  apply  the _-_B option to blur views together.  In most cases,
       two pictures with z-buffers at  v0  and  v1  will  get  a  satisfactory
       result,  though  the  perfectionist  may  wish  to apply the _-_f_f option
       together with the _-_f_r option of _p_i_n_t_e_r_p_.

       To use _p_m_d_b_l_u_r with _r_p_i_c_t_, apply the _-_S option to indicate a  rendering
       sequence, and set the _-_o option with a formatted file name to save mul-
       tiple output pictures.  When all the renderings are  finished,  combine
       them  with  the  _p_c_o_m_b_(_1_)  program,  using  appropriate scalefactors to
       achieve an average.  Note that using _r_p_i_c_t is MUCH more expensive  than
       using  _p_i_n_t_e_r_p_, and it is only recommended if the scene and application
       absolutely demand it (e.g. there is prominent refraction that  must  be
       modeled accurately).

       For  both  _p_i_n_t_e_r_p and _r_p_i_c_t_, the computation time will be proportional
       to the number of views from _p_m_d_b_l_u_r_.  We have  found  a  _n_s_a_m_p  setting
       somewhere  between 7 and 15 to be adequate for most images.  Relatively
       larger values are appropriate for faster camera motion.

       The _-_p_m and/or _-_p_d options of _r_p_i_c_t may be used instead or in  combina-
       tion  to  blur  animated  frames,  with the added advantage of blurring
       reflections and refractions according to their proper motion.  However,
       this  option  will  result in more noise and expense than using _p_m_d_b_l_u_r
       with _p_i_n_t_e_r_p as a post-process.  If both blurring methods are  used,  a
       smaller  value  should  be  given  to the _r_p_i_c_t _-_p_m option equal to the
       shutter speed divided by the number of  samples,  and  the  _-_p_d  option
       equal  to  the aperture divided by the number of samples.  This will be
       just enough to blur the boundaries of the ghosts which may appear using
       _p_m_d_b_l_u_r with a small number of time samples.

       To  simulate a particular camera's aperture, divide the focal length of
       the lens by the f-number, then convert to the corresponding world coor-
       dinate  units.   For  example,  if  you wish to simulate a 50mm lens at
       f/2.0 in a scene modeled in meters, then you divide 50mm by 2.0 to  get
       25mm, which corresponds to an effective aperture of 0.025 meters.

       interframe distance with an aperture of 0.1 world units:
