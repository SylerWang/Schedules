       _D_c_t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p takes four input files, forming a  matrix  expression.   The
       first argument is the View matrix file that specifies how window output
       directions are related to some set of measured values, such as an array
       of  illuminance  points  or images.  This matrix is usually computed by
       _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_(_1_) for a particular set of windows or skylight openings.  The
       second  argument is the window transmission matrix, or BSDF, given as a
       standard XML description.  The third argument is  the  Daylight  matrix
       file  that  defines  how  sky patches relate to input directions on the
       same opening.  This  is  usually  computed  using  _g_e_n_k_l_e_m_s_a_m_p_(_1_)  with
       _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b  in  a  separate run for each window or skylight orientation.
       The final input is the sky contribution  vector,  usually  computed  by
       _g_e_n_s_k_y_v_e_c_(_1_)_,  which  may  be  passed on the standard input.  This data
       must be in ASCII format, whereas the View  and  Daylight  matrices  are
       more efficiently represented as binary float data if machine byte-order
       is not an issue.

       Sent to the standard output of _d_c_t_i_m_e_s_t_e_p is either an ASCII color vec-
       tor  with as many RGB triplets as there are rows in the View matrix, or
       a combined _R_a_d_i_a_n_c_e picture.  Which output is produced depends  on  the
       _V_s_p_e_c  argument.  A regular file name will be loaded and interpreted as
       a matrix to generate a color results vector.  A file specification con-
       taining  a '%d' format string will be interpreted as a list of _R_a_d_i_a_n_c_e
       component pictures, which will be summed according to the computed vec-
       tor.
