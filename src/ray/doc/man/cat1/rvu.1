       _R_v_u generates RADIANCE images using _o_c_t_r_e_e_.  (The octree may  be  given
       as  the output of a command enclosed in quotes and preceded by a `!'.)
       Options specify the viewing parameters as well as giving  some  control
       over  the calculation.  Options may be given on the command line and/or
       read from the environment and/or read from a file.  A command  argument
       beginning  with a dollar sign ('$') is immediately replaced by the con-
       tents of the given environment variable.  A command argument  beginning
       with  an  at  sign ('@') is immediately replaced by the contents of the
       given file.  The options are the same  as  for  rpict(1),  with  a  few
       notable  exceptions.   The  _-_r_,  _-_z_, _-_S_, _-_P_, _-_P_P and _-_t options are not
       supported, and _-_o specifies which output device is being  used  instead
       of  the output file.  The _-_x_, _-_y and _-_p_a options are unnecessary, since
       _r_v_u scales the display image to the specified output device.  Addition-
       ally, the _-_b option improves the display on greyscale monitors, and _-_p_e
       may be used to set an initial exposure value.

       The _-_n option may be used to specify multiple processes, to  accelerate
       rendering.

       In the second form, the default values for the options are printed with
       a brief explanation.  In the third form, the list of  supported  output
       devices is displayed.

       _r_v_u  starts  rendering the image from the selected viewpoint and gradu-
       ally improves the resolution of the display until interrupted  by  key-
       board input.  _r_v_u then issues a prompt (usually ':') and accepts a com-
       mand line from the user.  _r_v_u may also stop its  calculation  and  wait
       for command input if the resolution of the display has reached the res-
       olution of the graphics device.   At  this  point,  it  will  give  the
       'done:' prompt and await further instructions.  If _r_v_u runs out of mem-
       ory due to lack of resources to store its computed image, it will  give
       the  'out  of  memory:'  prompt.  At this prompt, the user can save the
       image, quit, or even restart a new image, although this is  not  gener-
       ally recommended on virtual memory machines for efficiency reasons.

       _r_v_u  is  not meant to be a rendering program, and we strongly recommend
       that _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) be used instead for that purpose.   Since  _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_)  does
       not  store  its image in memory or update any display of its output, it
       is much faster and less wasteful of its resources  than  _r_v_u_.   _r_v_u  is
       intended  as  a  quick  interactive program for deciding viewpoints and
       debugging scene descriptions and is not suited for  producing  polished
       images.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       Once  the  program  starts, a number of commands can be used to control
       it.  A command is given by its name, which can be abbreviated, followed
       by its arguments.

       aaiimm _[ _m_a_g _[ _x _y _z _] _]
                 Zoom  in by _m_a_g on point _x _y _z _.  The view point is held con-
                 stant; only the view direction and size are changed.  If _x  _y
                 _z  is  missing, the cursor is used to select the view center.
                 A negative magnification factor means zoom out.  The  default
                 factor is one.

       ^^CC        Interrupt.  Go to the command line.

       eexxppoossuurree _[ _s_p_e_c _]
                 Adjust  exposure.   The  number  _s_p_e_c is a multiplier used to
                 compensate the average exposure.  A value of  1  renormalizes
                 the  image  to  the  computed  average, which is usually done
                 immediately after startup.  If _s_p_e_c begins with a '+' or '-',
                 the  compensation is interpreted in f-stops (ie. the power of
                 two).  If _s_p_e_c begins with an '=',  an  absolute  setting  is
                 performed.   An '=' by itself permits interactive display and
                 setting of the exposure.  If _s_p_e_c begins  with  an  '@',  the
                 exposure  is  adjusted  to present similar visibility to what
                 would be experienced in the real  environment.   If  _s_p_e_c  is
                 absent,  or an '@' is followed by nothing, then the cursor is
                 used to pick a specific image location for normalization.

       ffooccuuss _[_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_]
                 Set focus distance for depth-of-field sampling.   If  a  dis-
                 tance in world coordinates is absent, then the cursor is used
                 to choose a point in the scene on which to focus.  (The focus
                 distance  setting does not affect rendering in _r_v_i_e_w_, but can
                 be used in _r_p_i_c_t with the _-_p_d option  to  simulate  depth-of-
                 field on views saved from _r_v_i_e_w_._)

       ffrraammee _[ _x_m_i_n _y_m_i_n _x_m_a_x _y_m_a_x _]
                 Set  frame  for  refinement.   If coordinates are absent, the
                 cursor is used to pick frame boundaries.  If ``all'' is spec-
                 ified, the frame is reset to the entire image.

       ffrreeee      Free cached object structures and associated data.  This com-
                 mand may be useful when memory is low and a  completely  dif-
                 ferent view is being generated from the one previous.

       llaasstt _[ _f_i_l_e _]
                 Restore  the  previous  view.   If  a view or picture _f_i_l_e is
                 specified, the parameters are taken from the last view  entry
                 in the file.

       LL _[ _v_w _[ _r_f_i_l_e _] _]
                 Load  parameters  for  view  _v_w  from  the _r_a_d_(_1_) input file,
                 _r_f_i_l_e_.  Both _v_w and _r_f_i_l_e must be given the first  call,  but
                 subsequent  calls  will  use the last _r_f_i_l_e as a default, and
                 "1" as the default view (ie.  the  first  view  appearing  in
                 _r_f_i_l_e_)_.   If _r_v_u was started by _r_a_d_, then the _r_f_i_l_e parameter
                 will initially default to the rad input file used.

       mmoovvee _[ _m_a_g _[ _x _y _z _] _]
                 Move camera _m_a_g times closer to point _x _y _z _.  For a perspec-
                 tive  projection  (or  fisheye  view), only the view point is
                 changed; the view direction and size  remain  constant.   The
                 view  size must be modified in a parallel projection since it
                 determines magnification.  If _x _y _z is missing, the cursor is
                 used  to  select  the  view center.  A negative magnification
                 factor decreases the object size.  The default factor is one.
                 Care  must  be  taken  to avoid moving behind or inside other
                 objects.

       nneeww _[ _n_p_r_o_c _]
                 Restart the image, using the specified  number  of  rendering
                 processes.  Usually used after the "set" command.

       ppiivvoott _a_n_g_l_e _[ _e_l_e_v _[ _m_a_g _[ _x _y _z _] _] _]
                 Similar  to  the  "move" command, but pivots the view about a
                 selected point.  The _a_n_g_l_e is measured in degrees around  the
                 view  up vector using the right hand rule.  The optional _e_l_e_v
                 is the elevation in degrees from the  pivot  point;  positive
                 raises  the  view  point to look downward and negative lowers
                 the view point to look upward.

       qquuiitt      Quit the program.

       ^^RR        Redraw the image.  Use when the display gets  corrupted.   On
                 some  displays,  occassionally  forcing  a redraw can improve
                 appearance, as more color information is  available  and  the
                 driver can make a better color table selection.

       rroottaattee _a_n_g_l_e _[ _e_l_e_v _[ _m_a_g _] _]
                 Rotate  the camera horizontally by _a_n_g_l_e degrees.  If an ele-
                 vation is specified, the camera looks  upward  _e_l_e_v  degrees.
                 (Negative means look downward.)

       sseett _[ _v_a_r _[ _v_a_l _] _]
                 Check/change program variable.  If _v_a_r is absent, the list of
                 available variables is displayed.  If _v_a_l is absent, the cur-
                 rent  value of the variable is displayed and changed interac-
                 tively.  Otherwise, the variable _v_a_r assumes the  value  _v_a_l_.
                 Variables  include:  ambient value (av), ambient value weight
                 (aw), ambient bounces (ab), ambient  accuracy  (aa),  ambient
                 divisions  (ad),  ambient  radius (ar), ambient samples (as),
                 black&white (b), back face  visibility  (bv),  direct  jitter
                 (dj),  direct  sampling  (ds),  direct threshold (dt), direct
                 visibility (dv), irradiance (i),  limit  weight  (lw),  limit
                 recursion  (lr),  medium extinction (me), medium albedo (ma),
                 medium eccentricity (mg), medium sampling (ms), pixel  sample
                 (ps),  pixel  threshold  (pt), specular jitter (sj), specular
                 threshold (st), and uncorrelated sampling (u).  Once a  vari-
                 able  has  been  changed,  the  "new"  command can be used to
                 recompute the image with the new parameters.   If  a  program
                 variable  is  not  available  here, it may show up under some
                 other command or it may be impossible to change once the pro-
                 gram is running.

       ttrraaccee _[ _x_b_e_g _y_b_e_g _z_b_e_g _x_d_i_r _y_d_i_r _z_d_i_r _]
                 Trace a ray.  If the ray origin and direction are absent, the
                 cursor is used to pick a location in the image to trace.  The
                 object  intersected  and its material, location and value are
                 displayed.

       vviieeww _[ _f_i_l_e _[ _c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s _] _]
                 Check/change view parameters.  If _f_i_l_e is present,  the  view
                 parameters  are  appended  to a file, followed by _c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s if
                 any.  Alternatively, view options may be  given  directly  on
                 the  command line instead of an output view file.  Otherwise,
                 view parameters are displayed and changed interactively.

       VV _[ _v_w _[ _r_f_i_l_e _] _]
                 Append the current view as view _v_w in  the  rad  file  _r_f_i_l_e_.
                 Compliment  to  _L  command.   Note  that  the  view is simply
                 appended to the file, and previous views with the  same  name
                 should be removed before using the file with _r_a_d_.

       wwrriittee _[ _f_i_l_e _]
                 Write  picture  to _f_i_l_e_.  If argument is missing, the current
                 file name is used.

       ^^ZZ        Stop the program.  The screen will be redrawn when  the  pro-
                 gram resumes.
