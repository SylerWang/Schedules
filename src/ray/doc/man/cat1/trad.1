       _T_r_a_d is a graphical user interface to _r_a_d_(_1_)_, which controls the opera-
       tion of the basic Radiance scene compiling, rendering and picture  fil-
       tering  programs.  Trad also includes links to a few utilities for dis-
       playing and converting results, but most of what it does can be done by
       editing a small text file, called the "rad input file".  Scene creation
       still requires the use of a text or graphical  editor,  or  translation
       from some external CAD format.

       _T_r_a_d  is  based on the Tcl/Tk _w_i_s_h_(_1_) "windowing shell" written by John
       Ousterhout.  (See below for instructions on installing this package  if
       you do not have it already.)

       The  _t_r_a_d  interface  divides the rendering problem into seven screens:
       File, Scene, Zone, Views, Options, Action and Results.  The File screen
       is  used  to load and save rad input files (a.k.a. project files).  The
       Scene screen is used to name the Radiance input files associated with a
       particular  project.   The  Zone screen is used to assign _r_a_d variables
       specific to the section of the model being rendered.  The Views  screen
       is  used  to  define  specific views to be rendered and set the picture
       file names and dimensions.  The Options screen is used to  adjust  ren-
       dering quality and other parameters.  The Action screen is used to ini-
       tiate interactive and batch renderings.  The Results screen is used  to
       display, convert and print the rendered Radiance pictures.

       If  _t_r_a_d  is called with no rad input file name on the command line, it
       will start with the File screen and you must enter a valid project file
       before  you  will be allowed to continue.  If _r_f_i_l_e is given, then _t_r_a_d
       attempts to open this file.  If no such file exists, _t_r_a_d  assumes  you
       are  creating  a  new file by this name and goes to the Scene screen so
       you may identify the appropriate Radiance input  files.   If  the  file
       exists  but  not  all renderings have been finished, _t_r_a_d goes first to
       the Action screen, assuming you will want to do something.  If the file
       exists  and all renderings have completed and are up-to-date, _t_r_a_d goes
       to the Results screen so that you may examine the final pictures.

       _T_r_a_d includes an extensive help facility, which may be accessed  either
       by  pressing  the  "HELP" button and searching through the category and
       topic menus, or by holding the Control key and pressing the left  mouse
       button on the mysterious widget (i.e. the button, entry window, or list
       box you are curious about).

       The Tcl/Tk package is available  by  anonymous  ftp  from  ftp.smli.com
       (204.153.12.45)  in the /pub/tcl directory.  (Tcl stands for "Tool Com-
       mand Language," and is pronounced  "tickle".)   _T_r_a_d  is  based  on  Tk
       release  4.0, which in turn is based on Tcl release 7.4.  Although _t_r_a_d
       uses only the _w_i_s_h program from this package, _w_i_s_h  itself  depends  on
       additional  Tcl and Tk libraries, and the two toolkits must be compiled
       one after the other.

       To compile the Tcl/Tk package, download the  files  "tcl7.4.tar.Z"  and
       "tk4.0.tar.Z" and uncompress and untar them.  Then, follow the instruc-
       tions in the README file in the  tcl7.4/  directory  to  configure  the
       Makefile  for  your  system  and install the software.  (Usually, it is
       best to do this as root or have it done by your system administrator if
       you  do  not  have  root  privileges.)  Then, do the same in the tk4.0/
       directory.

       _T_r_a_d should run without modification once this is done correctly.
