       _N_e_a_t_e_n  reads  from its standard input and neatens up columns separated
       by white space using the specified format.  The format is a string con-
       sisting  of  a  positive integer followed by an alignment character and
       another integer.  The alignment character is usually  a  decimal  point
       ('.'), but it can be any non-digit.

       The  alignment  character  is used as the central point of each column.
       The total column field width will be the number  to  the  left  of  the
       alignment  character  plus  one for the alignment character itself plus
       the number to the right of the alignment character.

       If a field does not contain the alignment character, it will be printed
       to the left of where the alignment character would have appeared.  If a
       field is too long to print within  the  specified  format,  the  entire
       field will be printed and that row will not be aligned with the rest.

       The default format is "8.8".

BBUUGGSS
       Columns  wider than the total width of the format specification will be
       printed without any separating white space.

       The program does not do anything special with tabs on the input.
