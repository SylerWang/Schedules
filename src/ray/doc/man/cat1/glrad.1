       _G_l_r_a_d  renders  a Radiance scene description in OpenGL.  Its syntax and
       behavior is similar to _r_a_d_(_1_) with the  _-_o  option,  where  the  output
       device is assumed to be an X11 server with GLX extensions.

       The _-_w option turns off warnings.  The _-_s option tells _g_l_r_a_d to run _r_a_d
       silently, not echoing _o_c_o_n_v_(_1_) command.  The _-_b option turns  off  back
       face  visibility (i.e., enables back face culling).  This is equivalent
       to the _-_b_v option of _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) and _r_v_u_(_1_)_.  The _-_S option turns on full-
       screen   stereo  for  displays  that  support  it.   (Be  sure  to  run
       _/_u_s_r_/_g_f_x_/_s_e_t_m_o_n_(_1_)  or  its  equivalent  to  set  STR_TOP  or  STR_BOT,
       first.)   The  _-_v option may be used to specify a starting view, either
       by symbolic name as entered in the _v_i_e_w assignments in _r_f_i_l_e_, or  by  a
       complete  view specification, enclosed in quotes.  If no view is speci-
       fied, then the first standard view from _r_f_i_l_e is used to start.

       Variables permitted in _r_f_i_l_e are described  in  the  _r_a_d  manual  page.
       Additional  or  overriding assignments may be given on the command line
       following _r_f_i_l_e_.

       The view is controlled via the mouse and simple one-character commands,
       listed below:

       ((mmoouussee))   Modify  the  current  view.  The mouse is used to control the
                 current view in the following ways:

                 CONTROL   MOUSE     ACTION
                 (none)    left Move forward towards cursor position
                 (none)    right     Move backward away from cursor position
                 (none)    middle    Rotate in place (usually safe)
                 shift     left Orbit left around cursor position
                 shift     right     Orbit right around cursor position
                 shift     middle    Orbit skyward
                 cntl middle    Orbit earthward

                 For all movements but rotating in place, the cursor  must  be
                 placed  over some bit of visible geometry, otherwise the pro-
                 gram has no reference point from which to work.  It  is  best
                 to just experiment with these controls until you learn to fly
                 safely in your model.  And if you run into trouble,  the  'l'
                 command is very useful.  (See below.)

       ''++''       Zoom in on the current cursor position.  (Beware of repeating
                 keys that go faster than the display updates.)

       ''--''       Zoom out from the current cursor position.

       ''ll''       Return to the last saved  view.   Each  time  a  new  command
                 changes  the current view, the last view is saved, and may be
                 recalled with this command.  Multiple uses of the  same  com-
                 mand  (e.g.,  rotation,  zoom) will save only the view before
                 the first such command.  This way, it is easy to get back  to
                 where you were before a sequence of view changes.

       ''hh''       Fix  the head height.  All mouse-controlled view motions will
                 be adjusted so that the head height does  not  change  (where
                 vertical is determined by the current view up vector).

       ''HH''       Release  the  head height, allowing it to change again during
                 mouse-controlled movements.

       ''vv''       Print the current view parameters  to  the  standard  output.
                 This  is  useful for finding out where you are, or for saving
                 specific views in a keyframe file for animations or returning
                 to later.

       ''VV''       Append  the  current  view  to the original _r_f_i_l_e_.  This view
                 will be unnamed, but can be referred to by number or the user
                 may  add  a  name later with a text editor.  The current view
                 number becomes the last standard view.  (See the 'n' and  'p'
                 commands, below.)

       ''nn''       Go  to  the  next standard view stored in _r_f_i_l_e_.  If the last
                 view is currently displayed, then cycle to the first one.

       ''pp''       Go to the previous standard view stored  in  _r_f_i_l_e_.   If  the
                 first  view  is  currently  displayed, then cycle to the last
                 one.

       ''qq''       Quit _g_l_r_a_d_.  This is the normal way to exit the program.

       It would be nice if _g_l_r_a_d set the appropriate video format  for  stereo
       viewing  automatically,  but the process is different on different sys-
       tems and there is no single, sure-fire way to do it  for  all  systems.
       On  systems  that  do not support stereo extensions, the program may be
       compiled with the -DNOSTEREO option, which will avoid undefined  symbol
       errors.
