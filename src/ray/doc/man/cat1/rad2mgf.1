       _R_a_d_2_m_g_f converts one or more RADIANCE scene files to the Materials  and
       Geometry  Format (MGF).  Input units are specified with the _-_m_U option,
       where _U is one of 'm' (meters), 'c' (centimeters), 'f'  (feet)  or  'i'
       (inches).   The  assumed  unit  is meters, which is the required output
       unit for MGF (thus the need to know).  If the input dimensions  are  in
       none  of  these  units, then the user should apply _x_f_o_r_m_(_1_) with the _-_s
       option to bring the units into line prior to translation.

       The MGF material names and properties for the surfaces  will  be  those
       assigned  in  RADIANCE.  If a referenced material has not been defined,
       then its name will be invoked in the MGF output without definition, and
       the description will be incomplete.

       Although  MGF  supports  all of the geometric types and the most common
       material types used in RADIANCE, there  is  currently  no  support  for
       advanced  BRDF  materials,  patterns,  textures or mixtures.  Also, the
       special types "source" and "antimatter"  are  not  supported,  and  all
       light source materials are converted to simple diffuse emitters (except
       "illum" materials, which are converted  to  their  alternates).   These
       primitives  are  reproduced  as  comments  in  the  output  and must be
       replaced manually if necessary.

       The RADIANCE "instance" and "mesh" types aretreated specially.  _R_a_d_2_m_g_f
       converts  each  instance or mesh to an MGF include statement, using the
       corresponding transformation and a file name derived from the octree or
       mesh  name.   (The original octree/mesh suffix is replaced by ".mgf".)
       For this to work, the user must separately create  the  referenced  MGF
       files  from  the  original RADIANCE descriptions.  The description file
       names can usually be determined using the _g_e_t_i_n_f_o_(_1_) command run on the
       octrees in question.

       To convert three RADIANCE files (in feet) to one MGF file:

         rad2mgf -df file1.rad file2.rad file3.rad > scene.mgf

       To translate a RADIANCE materials file to MGF:

         rad2mgf materials.rad > materials.mgf
