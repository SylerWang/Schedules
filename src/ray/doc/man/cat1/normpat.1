       _N_o_r_m_p_a_t  normalizes one or more RADIANCE pictures to an average bright-
       ness of 1.0 and optionally removes fundamental frequencies  and  blends
       the  edges  of  the  image.  The original images are overwritten during
       this process, and it is recommended that the program work on copies  of
       the pictures for this reason.

       The  _-_r  option  can  be used to set the maximum horizontal or vertical
       resolution of the final result, which should not be  greater  than  256
       for  most  patterns (due to the associated memory burden during render-
       ing).  The _-_f option uses a Fourier transform to remove the lowest fre-
       quencies  from the image, reducing the noticeability of pattern repiti-
       tion.  The _-_b option can be used to blend the edges  of  the  image  so
       that  when  it  is  tiled,  the seams are less apparent.  The _-_v option
       turns on the verbose flag, which prints on the standard output progress
       messages as the script runs.

       _N_o_r_m_p_a_t  is  a shell script that makes calls to other RADIANCE programs
       that do the actual work.
