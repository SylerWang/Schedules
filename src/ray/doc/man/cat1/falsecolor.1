       _F_a_l_s_e_c_o_l_o_r produces a false color picture for lighting analysis.  Input
       is a rendered Radiance picture.

       By default, luminance is displayed on a linear scale  from  0  to  1000
       nits,  where  dark  areas  are blue and brighter areas move through the
       spectrum to red.  A different scale can be given with  the  _-_s  option.
       If  the  argument  given  to _-_s begins with an "a" for "auto," then the
       maximum is used for scaling the result.  The default multiplier is 179,
       which converts from radiance or irradiance to luminance or illuminance,
       respectively.  A different multiplier can be given with _-_m to get  day-
       light factors or whatever.  For a logarithmic rather than a linear map-
       ping, the _-_l_o_g option can be used,  where  _d_e_c_a_d_e_s  is  the  number  of
       decades below the maximum scale desired.

       A  legend  is  produced  for the new image with a label given by the _-_l
       option.  The default label is "Nits", which is appropriate for standard
       Radiance  images.  If the _-_i option of _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) was used to produce the
       image, then the appropriate label would be "Lux".

       If contour lines are desired rather than  just  false  color,  the  _-_c_l
       option  can  be  used.  These lines can be placed over another Radiance
       picture using the _-_p option.  If the input picture is  given  with  _-_i_p
       instead of _-_i_, then it will be used both as the source of values and as
       the picture to overlay with contours.  The _-_c_b option produces  contour
       bands  instead of lines, where the thickness of the bands is related to
       the rate of change in the image.  The _-_n option can be used  to  change
       the  number  of  contours  (and  corresponding legend entries) from the
       default value of 8.  The _-_l_w and _-_l_h options may be used to change  the
       legend  dimensions  from  the  default  width and height of 100x200.  A
       value of zero in either eliminates the legend in the output.

       The _-_e option causes extrema points to be printed on the brightest  and
       darkest pixels of the input picture.

       The  _-_s_p_e_c  option reinstates the old, spectral color scale used in the
       original _f_a_l_s_e_c_o_l_o_r_.  The remaining options, _-_r_, _-_g_,  and  _-_b  are  for
       changing the mapping of values to colors.  These are expressions of the
       variable _v_, where _v varies from 0 to 1.  These options are  not  recom-
       mended for the casual user.

       If no _-_i or _-_i_p option is used, input is taken from the standard input.
       The output image is always written to standard output, which should  be
       redirected.

       To create a false color image directly from _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_)_:

         rpict -vf default.vp scene.oct | falsecolor > scene.hdr

       To  create  a logarithmic contour plot of illuminance values on a Radi-
       ance image:

         rpict -i -vf default.vp scene.oct > irrad.hdr
         rpict -vf default.vp scene.oct > rad.hdr
         falsecolor -i irrad.hdr -p rad.hdr -cl -log 2 -l Lux > lux.hdr
