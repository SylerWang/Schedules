       _F_i_e_l_d_c_o_m_b combines two or more field frames into  half  as  many  final
       video  frames for field-based animations.  Normally, the even scanlines
       in the output are given over to the first, third, fifth, etc.  pictures
       given on the input, and the odd scanlines are given over to the second,
       fourth, sixth, etc. pictures on the input.  This  behavior  corresponds
       to  the  _-_e option, which is set by default.  To reverse this ordering,
       the _-_o option must be specified.

       Normally, _f_i_e_l_d_c_o_m_b will name output frames by dividing the numbers  on
       the  input field file names by 2, inserting a 'C' right before the num-
       ber, adding leading zeroes to make it always four digits.  For example,
       the command:

         fieldcomb anim12.hdr anim13.hdr anim14.hdr anim15.hdr

       will produce two output pictures:

         animC0006.hdr & animC0007.hdr

       If  an odd number of input files is given on the command line, the last
       file is held over and used as the first file in the next invocation  of
       _f_i_e_l_d_c_o_m_b  in  the same directory.  In this way, the program works well
       with the "TRANSFER" facility of _r_a_n_i_m_a_t_e_(_1_)_, which does  not  guarantee
       an even number of frames will be passed every time.

       If only two input files are given, the _-_f option may be used to specify
       a different output name of the user's choosing.

       If the _-_r option is specified, then the input  files  will  be  removed
       once they have been combined.
