       _P_e_x_t_r_e_m  locates  the minimum and maximum values for the input _p_i_c_t_u_r_e_,
       and prints their pixel locations and  color  values.   The  first  line
       printed  contains  the x and y pixel location (x measured from the left
       margin, y measured from the bottom), followed by  the  red,  green  and
       blue values.  The second line printed contains the same information for
       the maximum value.

       The _-_o option prints the original (radiance) values, undoing any  expo-
       sure or color correction done on the picture.

       If no input _p_i_c_t_u_r_e is given, the standard input is read.

       The  luminance value is used for comparison of pixels, although in cer-
       tain anomolous cases (ie. highly saturated colors) it is possible  that
       _p_e_x_t_r_e_m  will not pick the absolute minimum or maximum luminance value.
       This is because a fast integer-space comparison is used.  A more  reli-
       able  floating-point  comparison  would be slower by an order of magni-
       tude.
