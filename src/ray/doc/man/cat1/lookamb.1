       _L_o_o_k_a_m_b  examines  an  ambient file produced by _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_)_, _r_t_r_a_c_e_(_1_)_, or
       _r_v_u_(_1_)_.  The  default  mode  prints  the  position,  direction,  level,
       weight,  radius,  value,  position  gradient and direction gradient for
       each stored ambient value preceded by a  label  appropriate  for  human
       interpretation.  The _-_d option prints the same quantities in 18 columns
       without any expanatory text,  and  is  more  appropriate  as  input  to
       another program.

       The  _-_r  option  performs  the reverse conversion, taking the output of
       lookamb and reproducing the original ambient file on the standard  out-
       put.

       The _-_h option causes lookamb not to print out the header information on
       the output, or not to expect it on the input with the _-_r option.

       If no file is given, _l_o_o_k_a_m_b reads from the standard input.

NNOOTTEESS
       Before release 2.2 of Radiance, ambient files were in a  machine-depen-
       dent  format.   Since that is no longer the case, ambient files can now
       be moved freely between machines without any  conversions.   Thus,  the
       only reason to use _l_o_o_k_a_m_b now is to examine the contents of an ambient
       file.
