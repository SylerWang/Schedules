       _G_e_n_b_l_i_n_d_s  produces  a  RADIANCE scene description of a set of venetian
       blinds.  The _d_e_p_t_h of the blinds (X dimension) is given first, followed
       by  the _w_i_d_t_h (Y dimension), followed by the _h_e_i_g_h_t (Z dimension).  The
       number of slats to place evenly within this height is given as  _n_s_l_a_t_s_.
       The  _a_n_g_l_e of the blind, where zero is perfectly horizontal and a posi-
       tive angle tilts the positive X edge upwards, is given in degrees.  The
       blinds are initially situated so that the corner of the bottom blind is
       _h_e_i_g_h_t_/_n_s_l_a_t_s_/_2 above the XY plane, and all coordinates  are  positive.
       Each new slat is placed _h_e_i_g_h_t_/_n_s_l_a_t_s above the previous one, until the
       top slat is at _h_e_i_g_h_t _- _h_e_i_g_h_t_/_n_s_l_a_t_s_/_2 _.  The blinds may of course  be
       moved from this starting point with the _x_f_o_r_m_(_1_) command.

       If  curved  blinds are desired, a radius of curvature may be given with
       the _+_/_-_r option.  If given as _+_r_, The curvature is upward (which is the
       usual configuration).  If the option is given as _-_r_, then the curvature
       is downward.  The radius indicates how far from each slat its effective
       cylindrical  center  resides.   Each  slat  will be broken into as many
       polygons as is necessary to keep the delta changes in angle  less  than
       10  degrees.   (Note  that  this may result in a rather large number of
       polygons.)
