       _R_h_o_p_t_i_m_i_z_e  optimizes  beam  positions and eliminates fragment waste in
       the holodeck file _s_r_c___h_o_l_o_, writing the result to  _d_e_s_t___h_o_l_o_,  or  back
       into  _s_r_c___h_o_l_o if only one argument is given.  This may improve render-
       ing speed on large holodecks, which tend to have widely dispersed  beam
       positions that cause delays due to long file seeks.  It may also reduce
       the size of the file, since large holodecks become fragmented  as  they
       fill  up with new ray samples.  (Use the _r_h_i_n_f_o_(_1_) program to determine
       holodeck file fragmentation.)  The _-_u option adds a check to make  sure
       that  each  ray  sample is unique, i.e., the same sample is never given
       twice.  This check is usually unnecessary, but may eliminate  redundant
       samples from some holodeck files.

       If _r_h_o_p_t_i_m_i_z_e is given only one file argument, it creates  a  temporary
       file in the same directory, and moves it onto the original file once it
       has successfully completed its operation.  If the operation  fails  for
       some reason, the temporary file is removed and the original holodeck is
       left unchanged.

       This program generally takes several  minutes  to  run  and  offers  no
       progress reports.
