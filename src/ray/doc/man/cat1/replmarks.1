       _R_e_p_l_m_a_r_k_s replaces triangular markers identified by the  modifier  _m_o_d_-
       _n_a_m_e  in each scene description _f_i_l_e and writes the result to the stan-
       dard output.  The _-_x  option  indicates  that  each  marker  should  be
       replaced  by an appropriate _x_f_o_r_m_(_1_) command on _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_.  The _-_i option
       indicates that each marker should be replaced by an instance of _o_c_t_r_e_e_.
       The  _-_I  option  indicates  that  each  marker should be replaced by an
       instance of the Radiance mesh _m_e_s_h_.  One of these  three  options  must
       appear  on  the  command line, along with _m_o_d_n_a_m_e_, the modifier used by
       markers in the file.

       Multiple modifiers may be given, as long as each one is preceded by its
       own _-_x or _-_i option.

       The  transformation  for  each marker is determined by its location and
       orientation.  A marker should be a right triangle pointing like a half-
       arrow in the direction of the transformed x-axis, x'.  The longest side
       is the hypoteneuse, the second longest side is  the  x'-axis,  and  the
       third  longest  side indicates the direction of the y'-axis.  Any addi-
       tional sides will be ignored (ie. a quadrilateral may be  used  instead
       of  a  triangle if the extra side is small).  The z'-axis is determined
       by the cross product of the x' and y' axes, and the origin is the  com-
       mon vertex between x' and y'.

       The  size  of the marker is ignored unless the _-_s option is used, where
       _s_c_a_l_e is a multiplier for the x'-axis  length  to  indicate  the  total
       scale  factor.  For example, a _s_c_a_l_e value of 5 with a marker length of
       .5 would result in a total scale factor of 2.5 to be used in the trans-
       formation.

       The  _-_e  option  causes  commands  in  the  file to be expanded, and is
       required to replace markers from commands in the input file.  Even with
       this  option, _r_e_p_l_m_a_r_k_s will not examine objects for markers.  Specifi-
       cally, an object included by _r_e_p_l_m_a_r_k_s as a result of  a  _-_x  expansion
       will  be  transferred  verbatim, without regard to any surfaces therein
       that might have been considered as marks  if  they  were  on  the  main
       input.

       The _-_m option causes all replaced objects to be given the modifier _n_e_w_-
       _m_o_d_.  Otherwise, the new object  surfaces  will  use  their  originally
       defined  modifiers.   A different replacement modifier may be given for
       each marker type.  The marker modifier name  itself  is  only  used  to
       identify markers, and will not appear in the output in any form.

       If no input _f_i_l_e is given, the standard input is read.

       To  replace  all polygons with the modifier ``knobs'' in the file input
       with a transformed ``knob.rad'' and write the result to output:

         replmarks -x knob.rad knobs input > output

       To use instances of ``tree.oct'' with scaling set to  three  times  the
       tree marker length:
