       _C_o_m_p_a_m_b computes a good ambient value for the specified _r_a_d_(_1_) variable
       file and appends it to the file as a "render= -av" option.  If  the  _-_c
       option  is  specified,  then  _c_o_m_p_a_m_b includes color information in the
       computed ambient value, rather than estimating a grey  value  to  avoid
       rendering  color  shifts.   If the _-_e option is specified, then _c_o_m_p_a_m_b
       also computes a good exposure value for this scene, and appends  it  to
       the _r_a_d file as well.

       _C_o_m_p_a_m_b  is  a shell script that makes calls to other RADIANCE programs
       and utilities to do the actual work.  A substantial amount of time  may
       be  required  to  complete this script, since _c_o_m_p_a_m_b calls _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) to
       render low resolution frames for each view in  the  _r_a_d  file,  setting
       "QUALITY=High" to compute interreflections.  The resulting ambient file
       is thrown away, since it would disagree with the new -av  setting  used
       for the final renderings.  This method is preferable to setting the _-_a_w
       option of _r_p_i_c_t_, which frequently results in splotchy artifacts.
