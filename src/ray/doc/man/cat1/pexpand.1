       _P_e_x_p_a_n_d  reads  each metafile _f_i_l_e in sequence and expands any commands
       specified in a '+' option, and deletes any commands specified in a  '-'
       option.   This  is necessary because most drivers will not support many
       metafile commands such as 'v' (vector string) and  'O',  'C',  and  's'
       (segments).   _P_e_x_p_a_n_d  will expand '+' instances into the corresponding
       primitives which are supported, and delete all '-' instances.

       Certain commands are currently considered basic, and must be  supported
       by  all  drivers.   The commands 'D', 'E', 'S', 'U', 'R', 'l', 'r', and
       't' are basic (see metafile(5)).

       If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.
