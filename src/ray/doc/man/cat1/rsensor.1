       _R_s_e_n_s_o_r traces rays outward from one  or  more  specified  illumination
       sensors  into  the RADIANCE scene given by _o_c_t_r_e_e_, sending the computed
       sensor value to the standard output.  (The octree may be given  as  the
       output  of a command enclosed in quotes and preceded by a `!'.)  In the
       second form, the default values for  the  options  (modified  by  those
       options present) are printed with a brief explanation.

       Options  may be given on the command line and/or read from the environ-
       ment and/or read from a file.  A command argument beginning with a dol-
       lar  sign  ('$')  is  immediately replaced by the contents of the given
       environment variable.  A command argument beginning  with  an  at  sign
       ('@') is immediately replaced by the contents of the given file.

       The  sensor files themselves will be searched for in the path locations
       specified by the _R_A_Y_P_A_T_H environment variable, similar to  other  types
       of  Radiance auxiliary files.  If the sensor file path begins with '/',
       '.' or '~', no search will take place.  Before each sensor file, a sep-
       arate  view may be specified.  In this case, the view origin and direc-
       tion will correspond to the position and orientation of the sensor, and
       the  view  up vector will determine the zero azimuthal direction of the
       sensor.  The fore clipping distance may be used as well, but other view
       options will be ignored.  (See _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_) for details on how to specify a
       view.)  The actual data contained in the sensor file corresponds to the
       _S_P_O_T  tab-separated  matrix  specification, where the column header has
       "degrees" in the leftmost column, followed by  evenly-spaced  azimuthal
       angles.   Each  row begins with the polar angle, and is followed by the
       relative sensitivity values for each direction.  A low-resolution exam-
       ple of a sensor file is given below:

            degrees   0    90   180  270
            0    .02  .04  .02  .04
            45   .01  .02  .01  .02
            90   .001 .002 .001 .002

       As  well  as  different  views,  the  number  of samples may be changed
       between sensors, where the _-_r_d option controls the number of  ray  sam-
       ples  sent  at  random,  and the _-_d_n option controls the number of rays
       sent to each light source per sensor.

       The _-_h option toggles header output, which defaults to  "on."   The  _-_n
       option may be used to specify multiple calculation processes on systems
       with more than one CPU.  For additional options, consult the  _r_t_r_a_c_e_(_1_)
       man  page.  The final _o_c_t_r_e_e argument must be given, as the octree can-
       not be read from the standard input.
