       _G_e_n_k_l_e_m_s_a_m_p generates ray origins and directions to sample planar  sur-
       faces  needed to determine incident radiances or daylight coefficients.
       This command is typically used in conjunction with _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_(_1_) to ana-
       lyze exterior daylight coefficients for an annual simulation.

       The view options are needed to specify (at minimum) the view direction,
       which corresponds to the orientation of the surfaces, and the  view  up
       vector,  which  corresponds  to  the  azimuth=90-degree position on the
       Klems sampling hemisphere.  The view fore  clipping  distance  is  also
       quite  useful, as it provides a means to pass through some thickness in
       a fenestration system before samples are sent out.  Other view  options
       such  as  the  view  type  and  aft clipping distance are overridden or
       ignored.

       If no Radiance scene files are provided, then  the  specified  parallel
       view  defines  the width, height, center, and orientation of the window
       or facade of interest.  If one or more scene files are given, they  are
       presumed  to contain planar surfaces over which _g_e_n_k_l_e_m_s_a_m_p will origi-
       nate samples.  The sampled surface normals must correspond to the spec-
       ified view direction, and unaligned surfaces are silently ignored.

       The  _-_c  option specifies the number of rays to sample per Klems direc-
       tion.  These samples will be distributed evenly  over  the  surface(s).
       The default setting is 1000.

       The _-_f_f option specifies that output rays should be generated as 32-bit
       IEEE binary float  values.   This  may  be  more  efficient  if  passed
       directly to _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b or _r_t_r_a_c_e_(_1_) with the same option.  Likewise, the
       _-_f_d option specifies 64-bit IEEE binary  double  values.   The  default
       setting of _-_f_a produces ASCII floating point values.
