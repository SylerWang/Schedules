       _P_s_i_g_n produces a RADIANCE picture of the given _t_e_x_t_.  The output dimen-
       sions are determined by the character height, aspect ratio,  number  of
       lines  and  line length.  (Also the character size if text squeezing is
       used.)  If no _t_e_x_t is given, the standard input is read.

       --ccbb _r _g _b Set the background color to _r _g _b The default is white  (1  1
                 1).

       --ccff _r _g _b Set  the  foreground color to _r _g _b The default is black (0 0
                 0).

       --ddrr       Text reads to the right (default).

       --dduu       Text reads upwards.

       --ddll       Text reads to the left (upside down).

       --dddd       Text reads downwards.

       --hh _c_h_e_i_g_h_t
                 Set the character height to _c_h_e_i_g_h_t_.  The default is 32  pix-
                 els.

       --aa _a_s_p_e_c_t Set the character aspect ratio (height/width) to _a_s_p_e_c_t_.  The
                 default value is 1.67.

       --xx _x_s_i_z_e  Set the horizontal image size to _x_s_i_z_e_.  Use with  _-_y  option
                 (below)  in  place  of the _-_h specification to control output
                 image size directly.   If  the  character  aspect  ratio  _(_-_a
                 option,  above) is non-zero, then one of the specified x or y
                 output dimensions may be reduced to maintain this ratio.   If
                 direction is right _(_-_d_r_) or left _(_-_d_l_)_, then it is not neces-
                 sary to give the _-_y option, since it can be computed from the
                 character height _(_-_h_)_.

       --yy _y_s_i_z_e  Set the vertical image size to _y_s_i_z_e_.  Use with the _-_x option
                 (described above).  If direction is up _(_-_d_u_) or  down  _(_-_d_d_)_,
                 then  it is not necessary to give the _-_x option, since it can
                 be computed from the character height _(_-_h_)_.

       --ss _s_p_a_c_i_n_g
                 Set the intercharacter spacing to _s_p_a_c_i_n_g_.  The magnitude  of
                 this  value  is  multiplied  by the character height over the
                 aspect ratio (ie. the character width) to compute the desired
                 distance  between  characters in the output.  The sign of the
                 value, positive or negative, determines how this ideal  spac-
                 ing  is used in the actual placement of characters.  If _s_p_a_c_-
                 _i_n_g is positive, then the overall width of the line will  not
                 be affected, nor will indentation of textual elements.  Thus,
                 the text format will be mostly unaffected.  However,  spacing
                 between  characters  will  reflect  their relative size for a
                 more natural appearance.  If _s_p_a_c_i_n_g is negative,  characters
                 will  be  squeezed  together  to  meet the spacing critereon,
                 regardless of how it might affect the format of  the  output.
                 The  default  value for _s_p_a_c_i_n_g is zero, which is interpreted
                 as uniformly spaced characters.
