       _G_e_t_i_n_f_o  reads  the  header  of each RADIANCE _f_i_l_e and writes it to the
       standard output.  Octree and picture files  are  in  a  binary  format,
       which  makes it difficult to determine their content.  Therefore, a few
       lines of text are placed at the beginning of each file by the  RADIANCE
       program  that  creates  it.   The end of the header information and the
       start of the data is indicated by an empty line.  The _-_d option can  be
       used to print the dimensions of an octree or picture file instead.  For
       an octree, _g_e_t_i_n_f_o _-_d prints the bounding cube (xmin ymin  zmin  size).
       For  a  picture,  _g_e_t_i_n_f_o  _-_d prints the y and x resolution (-Y yres +X
       xres).  If no _f_i_l_e is given, the standard input is read.

       The second form of getinfo with a hyphen simply removes the header  and
       copies  the  body  of  the file from the standard input to the standard
       output.
