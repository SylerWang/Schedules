       _R_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b  computes  ray  coefficients  for objects whose modifiers are
       named in one or more _-_m settings.  These modifiers are usually  materi-
       als  associated with light sources or sky domes, and must directly mod-
       ify some geometric primitives to be considered in the output.  A  modi-
       fier  list  may also be read from a file using the _-_M option.  The RAY-
       PATH environment variable determines directories  to  search  for  this
       file.   (No search takes place if a file name begins with a '.', '/' or
       '~' character.)

       If the _-_n option is specified with a value  greater  than  1,  multiple
       _r_t_r_a_c_e  processes  will  be  used to accelerate computation on a shared
       memory machine.  Note that there is no benefit to using more  processes
       than  there  are local CPUs available to do the work, and the _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b
       process itself may use a considerable amount of CPU time.

       By setting the boolean _-_V option, you may instruct _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b to  report
       the  contribution  from  each material rather than the ray coefficient.
       This is particularly useful for light sources with  directional  output
       distributions,  whose  value  would  otherwise  be lost in the shuffle.
       With the default _-_V_- setting, the output of rtcontrib is a  coefficient
       that must be multiplied by the radiance of each material to arrive at a
       final contribution.  This is more  convenient  for  computing  daylight
       coefficeints,  or  cases where the actual radiance is not desired.  Use
       the _-_V_+ setting when you wish  to  simply  sum  together  contributions
       (with  possible  adjustment  factors) to obtain a final radiance value.
       Combined with  the  _-_i  or  _-_I  option,  irradiance  contributions  are
       reported  by  _-_V_+ rather than radiance, and _-_V_- coefficients contain an
       additonal factor of PI.

       The _-_c option tells _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b how many  rays  to  accumulate  for  each
       record.  The default value is 1, meaning a full record will be produced
       for each input ray.  For values greater than 1, contributions  will  be
       averaged together over the given number of input rays.  If set to zero,
       only a single record will be produced at the very end, corresponding to
       the sum of all rays given on the input (rather than the average).  This
       is equivalent to passing all the output records through a program  like
       _t_o_t_a_l_(_1_) to sum RGB values together, but is much more efficient.  Using
       this option, it is possible to reverse sampling, sending  rays  from  a
       parallel  source  such  as  the  sun to a diffuse surface, for example.
       Note that output flushing via zero-direction rays is disabled for accu-
       mulated evaluations.

       The  output of _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b has many potential uses.  Source contributions
       can be used as  components  in  linear  combination  to  reproduce  any
       desired  variation,  e.g., simulating lighting controls or changing sky
       conditions via daylight coefficients.  More generally, _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b can be
       used  to  compute  arbitrary input-output relationships in optical sys-
       tems, such as luminaires, light pipes, and shading devices.

       _R_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b calls _r_t_r_a_c_e_(_1_) with the -oTW (or -oTV) option  to  calculate
       the  daughter ray contributions for each input ray, and the output tal-
       lies are sent to one or more destinations according  to  the  given  _-_o
       specification.  If a destination begins with an exclamation mark ('!'),
       then a pipe is opened to a command and data is  sent  to  its  standard
       input.   Otherwise,  the destination is treated as a file.  An existing
       file of the same name will not be clobbered, unless the _-_f_o  option  is
       given.   If  instead  the  _-_r  option  is  specified,  data recovery is
       attempted on existing files.  (If _-_c _0 is used  together  with  the  _-_r
       option, existing files are read in and new ray evaluations are added to
       the previous results, providing a convenient means for progressive sim-
       ulation.)  If an output specification contains a "%s" format, this will
       be replaced by the modifier name.  The _-_b option may be used to further
       define a "bin number" within each object if finer resolution is needed,
       and this will be applied to a "%d" format in the output file specifica-
       tion  if  present.  The actual bin number is computed at run time based
       on ray direction and surface intersection, as described below.  If  the
       number of bins is known in advance, it should be specified with the _-_b_n
       option, and this is critical for output files containing multiple  val-
       ues  per  record.   A  variable  or constant name may be given for this
       parameter if it has been defined via a previous _-_f or _-_e option.  Since
       bin numbers start from 0, the bin count is always equal to the last bin
       plus 1.  Set the this value to 0 if  the  bin  count  is  unknown  (the
       default).   The  most recent _-_b_, _-_b_n and _-_o options to the left of each
       _-_m setting are the ones used for that modifier.  The ordering of  other
       options  is unimportant, except for _-_x and _-_y if the _-_c is 0, when they
       control the resolution string produced in the corresponding output.

       If a _-_b expression is defined for a particular modifier, the bin number
       will  be  evaluated  at run time for each ray contribution from _r_t_r_a_c_e_.
       Specifically, each ray's world intersection point will be  assigned  to
       the  variables Px, Py, and Pz, and the normalized ray direction will be
       assigned to Dx, Dy, and Dz.  These parameters may be combined with def-
       initions given in _-_e arguments and files read using the _-_f option.  The
       computed bin value will be rounded to the nearest whole  number.   This
       mechanism  allows the user to define precise regions or directions they
       wish to accumulate, such as  the  Tregenza  sky  discretization,  which
       would  be  otherwise  impossible to specify as a set of RADIANCE primi-
       tives.  The rules and predefined functions available for these  expres-
       sions  are described in the _r_c_a_l_c_(_1_) man page.  Unlike _r_c_a_l_c_, _r_t_c_o_n_t_r_i_b
       will search the RADIANCE library directories for each file given  in  a
       _-_f option.

       If  no  _-_o  specification is given, results are written on the standard
       output in order of modifier (as given on the  command  line)  then  bin
       number.   Concatenated data is also sent to a single destination (i.e.,
       an initial _-_o specification without formatting  strings).   If  a  "%s"
       format  appears but no "%d" in the _-_o specification, then each modifier
       will have its own output file, with multiple values per record  in  the
       case  of  a  non-zero  _-_b  definition.  If a "%d" format appears but no
       "%s", then each bin will get its own output file, with modifiers output
       in  order in each record.  For text output, each RGB coefficient triple
       is separated by a tab, with a newline at the end of  each  ray  record.
       For  binary  output formats, there is no such delimiter to mark the end
       of each record.

       Input and output format defaults to plain text, where each ray's origin
       and  direction (6 real values) are given on input, and one line is pro-
       duced per output file per ray.  Alternative data representations may be
       specified  by  the  _-_f_[_i_o_] option, which is described in the _r_t_r_a_c_e man
       page along with the associated _-_x and _-_y resolution settings.  In  par-
       ticular, the color ('c') output data representation together with posi-
       tive dimensions for _-_x and _-_y will  produce  an  uncompressed  RADIANCE
       picture, suitable for manipulation with _p_c_o_m_b_(_1_) and related tools.

       Options  may be given on the command line and/or read from the environ-
       ment and/or read from a file.  A command argument beginning with a dol-
       lar  sign  ('$')  is  immediately replaced by the contents of the given
       environment variable.  A command argument beginning  with  an  at  sign
       ('@') is immediately replaced by the contents of the given file.
