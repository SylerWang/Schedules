       _R_h_c_o_p_y adds ray sample data to the existing holodeck _d_e_s_t___h_o_l_o_.  In the
       first form, the ray samples are taken from one or more  holodeck  files
       given  after  the  _-_h  option.  In the second form, the ray samples are
       taken from one or more RADIANCE picture files and their depth  buffers,
       which must be paired on the command line after the _-_p option.

       The _-_u option turns on duplicate ray checking.  In some cases, the same
       ray may already exist in the destination  holodeck,  and  it  would  be
       redundant to add it.  By default, _r_h_c_o_p_y does not check for duplicates,
       because it takes extra time, and in many invocations is not  necessary,
       as when copying into an empty holodeck.

       The  _-_d  option  turns off depth checking.  Normally, _r_h_c_o_p_y checks the
       OBSTRUCTIONS variable of the destination holodeck, and if it is set  to
       True, makes sure that all contributing rays start outside each section.
       If OBSTRUCTIONS is set to False, then _r_h_c_o_p_y makes sure that  any  con-
       tributing  rays  end outside each section.  If OBSTRUCTIONS is not set,
       then this option has no effect.  (See the _r_h_o_l_o_(_1_) man page for a defi-
       nition of the OBSTRUCTIONS variable.)

       _R_c_o_p_y  cannot  be  used to create a holodeck -- use _r_h_o_l_o for this pur-
       pose.  For example, to create an  empty  holodeck,  run  _r_h_o_l_o  without
       either  the  _-_n or _-_o option.  Whatever variables are set by _r_h_o_l_o when
       the new holodeck is created are the ones that  will  have  effect  when
       later  rendering  or  viewing.   Since the ray sample data may be taken
       from any source, _r_h_o_l_o and _r_h_c_o_p_y may be used together to  change  cer-
       tain  unalterable  holodeck parameters, such as the section grid geome-
       try.

       To take data from an existing holodeck after changing the section grid:

         rholo new.hdk new.hif
         rhcopy new.hdk -h old.hdk

       To add ray samples from two pictures to the new holodeck:

         rhcopy new.hdk -p view1.hdr view1.zbf view2.hdr view2.zbf

       _R_h_c_o_p_y  attempts to place the beams in the holodeck in a good order for
       quick access, but if the data comes from multiple sources, the  results
       may not be optimal.  For large holodecks, it is sometimes useful to run
       the _r_h_o_p_t_i_m_i_z_e_(_1_) program once all runs of _r_h_c_o_p_y are through.
