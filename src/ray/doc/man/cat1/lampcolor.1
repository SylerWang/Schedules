       _L_a_m_p_c_o_l_o_r is an interactive program for computing the appropriate color
       for a diffuse emitter.  From  the  total  lumen  output  and  a  simple
       description of the fixture geometry, the radiance for a diffuse fixture
       is calculated.  Since most light fixtures are not really  diffuse,  the
       preferred   method   is   to   use  luminaire  distribution  data  (see
       _i_e_s_2_r_a_d_(_1_)_)_.

       A table of lamp colors and depreciation factors  is  used  to  get  the
       color for a specific lamp type.  If "white" is specified, the lamp will
       be uncolored.  This is probably preferable for scenes with only a  sin-
       gle variety of lamp in order to produce color-balanced images.
