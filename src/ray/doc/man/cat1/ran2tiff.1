       _R_a_n_2_t_i_f_f takes an animated sequence of Radiance pictures  and  converts
       them  by  calling  _p_c_o_n_d_(_1_)  and _r_a___t_i_f_f_(_1_) in such a way that exposure
       changes gradually from one frame to the next.  It accomplishes this  by
       computing  a  histogram  for each image and blending it with a weighted
       histogram from the previous frame, where the weight is set  by  the  _-_W
       option, or 0.9 by default.  A value of 0.5 would mean that the previous
       frame carries 1/2 the weight of the current one, and the  frame  before
       that 1/4, 1/8 before that, and so on.

       The  _-_H option specifies a histogram file to be used to ensure continu-
       ous exposure between the current sequence and one before  it.   If  the
       file  does  not exist, it will be created at the end of the conversion.
       If it does exist, its contents will be used as the histogram at the end
       of the previous sequence.

       The  _-_D  option  may  be  used  to  specify an output directory for the
       resulting TIFF frames.  Otherwise, the current directory will be  used.
       The  output  file  names will correspond to the input names, but with a
       ".tif" suffix.

       Ran2tiff also accepts the  standard  options  for  _p_c_o_n_d  and  _r_a___t_i_f_f_,
       though output to LogLuv TIFF formats is not supported.  (There would be
       no point in adjusting the exposure if the output were HDR.)

       To convert a sequence of frames using a rapid human  exposure  response
       and LZW compression on the output:

         ran2tiff -W 0.7 -h -z frame*.hdr

       Similar  to  _f_i_e_l_d_c_o_m_b_(_1_)_,  this program works well with the "TRANSFER"
       facility of _r_a_n_i_m_a_t_e_(_1_)_.
