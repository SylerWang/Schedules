       In  the  first  form, _v_w_r_i_g_h_t shifts a RADIANCE view the specified dis-
       tance to the right, putting out a complete set of view parameters in  a
       single line on the standard output.  This utility is most often used to
       compute a right-eyed view from a left-eye view for stereo imaging.

       If no options are specified on the command line, _v_w_r_i_g_h_t reads  a  view
       from its standard input.

       The  _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e  given  is  in  world coordinate units.  A negative value
       indicates a shift to the left rather than the right.

       The second form substitutes a name prefix in place of  the  shift  dis-
       tance,  and  produces constant assignments on the standard output suit-
       able for passing directly to _r_c_a_l_c_(_1_)_.  For a given prefix _N_, the  con-
       stant names are as follows:

       Nt:  view type ('v'==1,'l'==2,'a'==3,'h'==4,'c'==5,'s'==6)
       Npx: view point x value
       Npy: view point y value
       Npz: view point z value
       Ndx: view direction x value (normalized)
       Ndy: view direction y value (normalized)
       Ndz: view direction z value (normalized)
       Nd:  view focal distance
       Nux: view up vector x value (normalized)
       Nuy: view up vector y value (normalized)
       Nuz: view up vector z value (normalized)
       Nh:  view horizontal size
       Nv:  view vertical size
       Ns:  view shift
       Nl:  view lift
       No:  view fore clipping distance
       Na:  view aft clipping distance
       Nhx: derived horizontal image vector x value (normalized)
       Nhy: derived horizontal image vector y value (normalized)
       Nhz: derived horizontal image vector z value (normalized)
       Nhn: derived horizontal image vector multiplier
       Nvx: derived vertical image vector x value (normalized)
       Nvy: derived vertical image vector y value (normalized)
       Nvz: derived vertical image vector z value (normalized)
       Nvn: derived vertical image vector multiplier

       To  start  _r_p_i_c_t_(_1_)  on  a view .06 meters left of the view in the file
       "right.vf":

         rpict `vwright -.06 < right.vf` scene.oct > right.hdr &

       To move the _r_a_d_(_1_) view named "left" 2.5 inches to the right and render
       from there:

         rad  -v  "right  `rad  -n  -s  -V  -v  left examp.rif | vwright 2.5`"
         examp.rif &

       To pass a view to _r_c_a_l_c for conversion to some other view:

         rcalc -n -e `vwright orig < orig.vf` -f  viewmod.cal  -o  view.fmt  >
         new.vf
