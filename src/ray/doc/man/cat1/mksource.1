       _M_k_s_o_u_r_c_e produces a RADIANCE scene description of distant illum sources
       corresponding to bright, concentrated  regions  in  the  given  ambient
       environment.   Any local geometry is ignored in the input octree, which
       should be derived from a captured light probe and modeled as a  distant
       hemispherical or spherical glow source.  The output sources may then be
       combined with this environment to produce a more  efficient  scene  for
       rendering, faster and less prone to sampling artifacts.

       The  _-_d  option may be used to specify the number of ray samples, which
       defaults to 262,000.  Calculation time is roughly proportional to  this
       setting,  and the default is fine enough to resolve sources the size of
       the sun (half a degree) or larger.

       The _-_t option may be used to manually set the  radiance  threshold  for
       sources, in watts/sr/meter^2.  The default uses the top 2 percentile of
       the environment, which is usally a good value.

       The _-_a option may be used to specify a maximum source  diameter,  which
       defaults  to  15  degrees.   _M_k_i_l_l_u_m silently enforces a maximum of 180
       degrees for this option.

       If no input octree is specified, the standard input is read.

       To add sources with a maximum size of 20  degrees  to  the  enviornment
       described in environ.oct:

         mksource -a 20 environ.oct > srcs.rad
         oconv -i environ.oct srcs.rad > env+srcs.oct
