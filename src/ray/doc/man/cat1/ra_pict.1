       RRaa__ppiicctt converts a Radiance picture, as produced by rrppiicctt (1) to a Mac-
       intosh PICT file. The picture will be a 24 bit PICT 2 picture, using  a
       single bit map (DirectRect).

       --gg _g_a_m_m_a  This sets an explict gamma correction for the image. If it is
                 not specified, the default value of 2.0 is used.

       --vv        Invokes verbose mode, and gives line on standard error giving
                 the size of the picture and the gamma correction used.

       --ee ++//-- _s_t_o_p_s
                 Adjusts the exposure by stops.

       _i_n_f_i_l_e    Specifies the file to read the picture from. If none is spec-
                 ified, it takes it from standard input. If standard input  is
                 used, then the picture is sent to standard output.

       _o_u_t_f_i_l_e   Specifies the file to send the PICT file to. If none is spec-
                 ified, it is sent to standard output.

           ra_pict mypict.hdr mypict.pict

       Will convert the Radiance picture mypict.hdr, giving the Macintosh PICT
       mypict.pict.

           ra_pict -g 2.2 mypict.hdr mypict.pict

       Will convert the file using a gamma of 2.2.

       Does  not yet do Macintosh PICT to Radiance PIC, as this PICT files are
       a lot more complex than just one bit map. This is left as  an  exercise
       for the reader :-)
