       _T_o_t_a_l sums up columns of real numbers from one or more files and prints
       out the result on its standard output.

       By  default,  _t_o_t_a_l  computes the straigt sum of each input column, but
       multiplication can be specified instead with the _-_p option.   Likewise,
       the  _-_u  option means find the upper limit (maximum), and _-_l means find
       the lower limit (minimum).

       Sums of powers can be computed  by  giving  an  exponent  with  the  _-_s
       option.  (Note that there is no space between the _-_s and the exponent.)
       This exponent can be any real number, positive or negative.  The  abso-
       lute value of the input is always taken before the power is computed in
       order to avoid complex results.  Thus, _-_s_1 will produce a sum of  abso-
       lute values.  The default power (zero) is interpreted as a straight sum
       without taking absolute values.

       The _-_m option can be used to compute the mean rather  than  the  total.
       For sums, the arithmetic mean is computed.  For products, the geometric
       mean is computed.  (A logarithmic sum of absolute  values  is  used  to
       avoid overflow, and zero values are silently ignored.)

       If  the  input  data  is binary, the _-_i_d or _-_i_f option may be given for
       64-bit double or 32-bit float values, respectively.  Either option  may
       be  followed  immediately  by  an  optional count, which defaults to 1,
       indicating the number of double or float  binary  values  to  read  per
       record  on  the  input file.  (There can be no space between the option
       and this count.)  Similarly, the _-_o_d and  _-_o_f  options  specify  binary
       double  or  float  output,  respectively.   These options do not need a
       count, as this will be determined by the number of input channels.

       A count can be given as the number of lines to read before computing  a
       result.   Normally,  _t_o_t_a_l  reads each file to its end before producing
       its result, but this behavior may  be  overridden  by  inserting  blank
       lines in the input.  For each blank input line, total produces a result
       as if the end-of-file had been reached.  If two blank lines immediately
       follow  each  other, total closes the file and proceeds to the next one
       (after reporting the result).  The _-_N option  (where  N  is  a  decimal
       integer)  tells  _t_o_t_a_l  to  produce  a result and reset the calculation
       after every N input lines.  In addition, the _-_r option can be specified
       to  override  reinitialization  and  thus  give a running total every N
       lines (or every blank line).  If the end of file is reached,  the  cur-
       rent total is printed and the calculation is reset before the next file
       (with or without the _-_r option).

       The _-_t_C option can be used to specify the input and output tab  charac-
       ter.  The default tab character is TAB.

       If no files are given, the standard input is read.

       To compute the RMS value of colon-separated columns in a file:

         total -t: -m -s2 input

       To produce a running product of values from a file:

         total -p -1 -r input

BBUUGGSS
       If  the  input  files have varying numbers of columns, mean values will
       certainly be off.  _T_o_t_a_l will ignore missing column entries if the  tab
       separator  is  a  non-white  character, but cannot tell where a missing
       column should have been if the tab character is white.
